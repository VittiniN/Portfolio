    <h1> ABOUT ME  </h1>
   <p> 
    I have been in the finance industry for about 5+ years, worked at the top banks, and was promoted multiple times to manager roles, 
 but I still did not feel passionate about my finance career. I had to take a step back, 
 reevaluate what I wanted my life to look like, and figure out what I enjoyed doing. 
 I love building things, being creative, learning, and solving problems and challenges. 
 I decided to dabble in Javascript and realized I loved it, so I decided to jump head-first into front-end development. 
 I first taught myself the basics before joining a Bootcamp and practicing daily. 
 Although things got tough, I never stopped learning.
