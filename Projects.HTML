    <p> 
        Interesting story about this project, during my  daily, stand up 
        with my previous employer, we had to come up with icebreaker questions
        at first, everything seemed fine until the team realized we were repeating 
        the same questions, I decided to save us the headache and build a
        icebreaker website that generates the questions with a click of a button.
        I used <span>HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT,GITHUB </span>and <span>NETLIFIFY</span>to build this web app.

    <h4> Private Data</h4>
    <p> I worked closely with the director the engineer team  to build an API 
        that fetches data from Entrata, a property managment software, this allowed us to 
        pull data such as leads and  resident details and much more. To achieve this 
        I used JSON,JAVASCRIPT AND HTML.

        <h3> TO DO LIST APP</h3>
        <h4> In progress </h4>
        <p> I find myself struggling to find a to-do list application that works for me 
            I am building a simple to-do web application that allows you to set reminders on 
            your essential task and helps you stay on top of priority tasks.
